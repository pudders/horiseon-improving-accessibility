            <h2>Search Engine Optimization</h2>
            <p>
                The dominance of mobile internet use means that users are searching for the right business as they
                travel, shop, or sit on their couch at home. Search Engine Optimization (SEO) allows you to increase
                your visibility and find the right customers for your business.

The laptop appears to show a slide from a slideshow, with the word Reputation at the top. There is a bar graph below on the left, with months on the x axis, the bars are increasing in height and there is an arrow pointing upwards along the graph. Next to this are 3 circles showing percentages and then a pie chart on the right. "> <!--added alt text to img -->
            <h2>Online Reputation Management</h2>
            <p>
                The web is full of opinions, and some of these can be negative. Social media allows anyone with an
                internet connection to say whatever they want about your business. Online Reputation Management gives
                you the control over what potential customers see when they search for your business.

There are three mugs of black coffee at the tabe and circular picture of various icons (a heart, a star, a music note etc.) scattered over the table covering most of it. There are four cut outs of speech bubbles each with a different word on, the words are Share, Tweet, Media and Like."> <!--added alt text to img -->
            <h2>Social Media Marketing</h2>
            <p>
                Social media continues to have a sizable influence on buying habits. Social media marketing helps you
                determine which platforms are suited to your brand, using analytics to find the right markets and
                increase your lead generation.

            <p>
                Inbound strategies for lead generation require less work for your business, bringing customers directly
                to your website.
